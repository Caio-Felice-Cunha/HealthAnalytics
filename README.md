## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> Data source: 
[ILPD (Indian Liver Patient Dataset) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset))

We are going to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether or not a patient will develop liver disease based on several patient characteristics. This model can help doctors, hospitals or governments to better plan their health spending budget or even create prevention policies.

## Solution Strategy
As our goal is to predict a class (yes or no), we will use supervised learning for classification, creating different versions of the model with different algorithms and going through the entire Machine Learning process from end to end.


## Next Steps
* Improve hyperparameters and data classification.
