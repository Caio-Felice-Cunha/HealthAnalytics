## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> Data source: 
[ILPD (Indian Liver Patient Dataset) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset))

We are going to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether or not a patient will develop liver disease based on several patient characteristics. This model can help doctors, hospitals or governments to better plan their health spending budget or even create prevention policies.

## Solution Strategy
As our goal is to predict a class (yes or no), we will use supervised learning for classification, creating different versions of the model with different algorithms and going through the entire Machine Learning process from end to end.
* Step 01: Exploratory Data Analysis (Exploration of Numerical/Categorical Variables);
* Step 02: Label encoding for the Categorical variable;
* Step 03: Checking the Relationship Between Attributes;
* Step 04: Checking for Missing Values and Duplicate Records;
* Step 05: Data Cleanup - Duplicate Records Handling & Handling Outliers & Handling Missing Values;
* Step 06: Pre-Processing Data for Building Machine Learning Models;
* Step 07: Split into Training and Test & Class Balancing & Data Standardization;
* Step 08: Model 01 with Logistic Regression;
* Step 09: Model 02 with Random Forest;
* Step 10: Model 3 with KNN;
* Step 11: Model 4 with Decision Tree;
* Step 12: Model 5 with SVM;
* Step 13: Predictions with the Best Trained Model.


## Next Steps
* Improve hyperparameters and data classification.
